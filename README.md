# Roboteq Linux Driver

This is forked from the original Roboteq Linux API which has been found to be outdated(last updated 2014). Many fixes were made in another [fork](https://github.com/brettpac/Roboteq-Linux-API).

This library derives from improvements made by @brettpac and adds support for RoboCAN based ID referencing for the motors and Debug support.

The older Readme is as follows

```
# Roboteq-Linux-API

This is a branch of the Roboteq Linux API (http://www.roboteq.com/index.php/support/downloads) for the Roboteq NxtGen Series of Motor Controllers. After my own difficulties with the API, some forum posts and telephone conversations with Roboteq support, my conclusion is that there are some serious problems with the API as it currently is and this is my attempt to get it working.
